## Polar Coordinates & Equations

The coordinates of P can be written in Cartesian form as $(x,y)$ but can be written as $(r,\theta)$ in polar form where $r$ is the distance from the origin and $\theta$ is the angle of rotation from the positive X-axis.

To convert from polar to Cartesian you can use the following:

- $r \cos\theta = x$
- $r \sin\theta = y$
- $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$
- $\theta = \arctan(\frac{y}{x})$



Polar equations are usually given in the form $r = f(\theta)$ so as $\theta$ varies from 0 to $2\pi$ points are placed around the whole graph varying distance.

## Sketching curves

Common curves are: 
- $r = a$, a circle with centre origin radius $a$ 
- $\theta = \alpha$, a half line making angle $\alpha$ 
- $r = a\theta$, a spiral starting at origin
- $r = a(1 + q \cos\theta)$, They are called ***Cardioids*** (are given in the form $r = a(1 + q \cos\theta)$. They are defined for all $\theta$ if $p > q$)

Cardioids fall into 2 categories "egg" shaped and those with a "dimple", egg shaped are convex curves, dimples are concave at $\theta = \pi$

They are egg shaped when $p > 2q$ and dimple shaped if $q < p < 2q$.


## Area enclosed by a Polar Curve

The area enclosed by a polar curve and half lines $\theta = \alpha, \theta = \beta$ where $\theta$ is measured in radians is given as:

$$A = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} r^2 d\theta$$

## Tangent to polar Curve:

You can differentiate parametrically to get:

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\frac{d\theta}{d\theta}}{\frac{dx}{d\theta}}$$

To find a tangent line to the parallel to the initial set:

$$\frac{dy}{d\theta} = 0$$

To find a tangent perpendicular to the initial line set:

$$\frac{dx}{d\theta} = 0$$
