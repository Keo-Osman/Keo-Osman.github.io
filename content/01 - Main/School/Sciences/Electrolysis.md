#### For molten ionic compounds:
The cation will move to the cathode where it will receive electrons to become an atom cations you can say they are reduced (reduction electrons gained) 

The anion will move the anode where it lose electrons to become an atom you can say they are oxidised at the anode. Sometimes , for example with oxygen, The anion will react with the anode so the anode has to be replaced periodically.

The ionic compound can be mixed with cryolite to reduce itâ€™s melting point.

#### For Aqueous Solutions:
The solution will contain H+, OH- ions as well as the ions from the compound.
The **LESS REACTIVE** cation will move to the cathode. So hydrogen gas will be mad at the cathode if it is less reactive than the metal

If a Halide ion is present then it will be oxidised at the anode otherwise the oxygen from the OH- will be oxidised at the anode and oxygen gas is produced
