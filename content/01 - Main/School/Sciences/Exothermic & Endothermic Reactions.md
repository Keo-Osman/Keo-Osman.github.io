Energy is needed to break chemical bonds and it is released when bonds are made

# Exothermic

Energy is released from the reaction to the surroundings, decreasing the temperature of reactants but increasing temperature of the surroundings

# Endothermic

Energy is absorbed into the reaction from the surroundings, increasing the temperature of reactants but decreasing temperature of the surroundings
