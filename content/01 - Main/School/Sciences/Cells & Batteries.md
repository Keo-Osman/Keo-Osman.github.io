# In Chemistry

* Cells contain chemicals that when react produce a *Potential Difference*
* They generally consist of 2 metals in contact with an electrolyte.
* Non-Renewable cells cannot be use once all chemicals are used up but Renewable ones can when a potential difference is supplied causing the revers reaction

### Hydrogen Fuel Cells

* Contain hydrogen and oxygen (separated) that when combined produce a *Potential Difference*
