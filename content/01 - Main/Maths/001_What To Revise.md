### Needs work all round
- 2.2 [[Groups]] (FP2)  - Very difficult lots of memorisation and lots of questions
- 1.1 [[Vectors#A-Level Further Pure 1|Vectors]] (FP1) - Fair amount of memorisation and lots of questions
- 1.8 [[Numerical Methods]] (FP1) - Just got to do loads of questions as I find them very counterintuitive but there is not lots to memorise
- 1.9 [[Vectors]] (CP1) - Very difficult lots of memorisation and lots of questions
- 2.1 [[Number Theory]] (FP2) - Lots of memorisation and after a bit of questions should be fairly easy
- 1.6 [[Taylor Series]] - Mainly solutions for differential equations, Just got to do loads of questions as I find this counter intuitive 
- 2.4 [[Recurrence Relations]] (FP2) - Just got to keep all of the question types fresh in my head
- 2.7 [[Differential Equations#A-Level Further Core 2 (Solving)|Differential Equations]] (CP2) - Just got to keep all of the question types fresh in my head
- 2.8 [[Differential Equations#A-Level Further Core 2 (Modelling)|Modelling with Differential Equations]] (CP2) - Just got to keep all of the question types fresh in my head
- 2.5 [[Matrices#A-Level Further Pure 2 (Matrix Algebra)|Matrix Algebra]] (FP2) - Got to memorise some key facts but there aren’t that many question types so I should be fine after doing a fair amount of questions
- 1.3 [[Conic Sections#A-Level Further Pure 1 (Conic Sections 2)|Conic Sections 2]] (FP1) - Got to memorise key parametric and cartesian equations as well as other stuff, Questions aren’t too hard
- 2.1 [[Complex Numbers#A-Level Further Core 2|Exponential Form of Complex Numbers]](CP2)
#### Need to remember specific facts/equations but can mostly solve questions with said facts given
- 1.3 [[Conic Sections#A-Level Further Pure 1 (Conic Sections 2)|Conic Sections 2]] (FP1) - Got to memorise key parametric and cartesian equations as well as other stuff, Questions aren’t too hard but do need a little practice
- 1.2 [[Conic Sections#A-Level Further Pure 1 (Conic Sections 1)|Conic Sections 1]] (FP1) - Got to memorise key parametric and cartesian equations as well as other stuff, Questions aren’t too hard but do need a little practice
- 2.6 [[Integration#A-Level Further Pure 2|Integration Techniques]] (FP2) Need to memorise key formula for volume of revolution but questions aren’t too bad. Need lot’s of Practice on reduction formula
- 2.6 [[Hyperbolic Trigonometric Functions]] (CP2) - Just need to flashcard memorise inverse functions in logarithms, derivatives and integrals
- 1.5 [[The T-Formulae]] (FP1) - Just need to flashcard memorise how to define trig functions in terms of $t$
- 1.4 [[Sum and Product of Roots]] (CP1) - Just need to flashcard memorise formula
- 1.3 [[Series]] (CP1) - Just need to memorise standard results

### Mostly got it
Overall just need to practice questions but not much memorisation needed
- 2.5 [[Polar Coordinates]] (CP2)
- 1.6 [[Matrices]] (CP1) - Need to remember determinant, inverses and multiplication
- 1.7 [[Linear Transforms]] (CP1)
- 1.8 [[Proof By Induction]] (CP1)
- 1.4 [[Inequalities]] (FP1)
- 1.7 [[Methods In Calculus]] (FP1)
- 1.9 [[Differential Equations#A-Level Further Pure 1 - Reducible Differential Equations|Reducible Differential Equations]]
### Easy
Only need to do a few questions
- 1.1 [[Complex Numbers]] (CP1)
- 1.2 [[Complex Plane]] (CP1)
- 1.5 [[Volumes Of Revolution]] (CP1)
- 2.4 [[Volumes Of Revolution]] (CP2)
- 2.3 [[Integration#A-Level Further Core 2|Advanced Integration]] (CP2)
- 2.2 [[Series#A-Level Further Core 2|Advance Series]] (CP2)
- 2.3 [[Complex Numbers#A-Level Further Pure 2|Complex Numbers]] (FP2)

# A-Level
Only included topics that I need to revise and omitted should need no dedicated revision
## Year 1
### Pure
- Trigonometric Equations and Identities
- Exponentials and Logarithms (more the data/modelling part)
### Stats
- Basically review everything - The maths itself is really straightforward just need to remember definitions and how to do questions
### Mechanics
- **NEED TO REMEMVER SUVAT** *and how to derive*
- A bit of gravity questions
- Connected particle questions - **ESPECIALLY SCALE PAN/LIFT/ELEVATOR WUESTIONS**
- Pulleys

## Year 2
### Pure
- A Bit of partial fractions
- Remember series definitions
- Binomial Expansion
- Trigonometric Modelling
- Implicit Differentiation
- Numerical Methods
- Integration Techniques
- A bit of Vectors
### Stats
- Review all of stats (Very short) mainly Normal distribution
### Mechanics
- Go over everything just do questions and as the actual maths is not difficult is just figuring what’s affecting what in the diagram
