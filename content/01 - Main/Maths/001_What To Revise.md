### Needs work all round

* 2.2 [Groups](Groups.md) (FP2)  - Very difficult lots of memorisation and lots of questions
* 1.1 [Vectors](Vectors.md#a-level-further-pure-1) (FP1) - Fair amount of memorisation and lots of questions
* 1.8 [Numerical Methods](Numerical%20Methods.md) (FP1) - Just got to do loads of questions as I find them very counterintuitive but there is not lots to memorise
* 1.9 [Vectors](Vectors.md) (CP1) - Very difficult lots of memorisation and lots of questions
* 2.1 [Number Theory](Number%20Theory.md) (FP2) - Lots of memorisation and after a bit of questions should be fairly easy
* 1.6 [Taylor Series](Taylor%20Series.md) - Mainly solutions for differential equations, Just got to do loads of questions as I find this counter intuitive 
* 2.4 [Recurrence Relations](Recurrence%20Relations.md) (FP2) - Just got to keep all of the question types fresh in my head
* 2.7 [Differential Equations](Differential%20Equations.md#a-level-further-core-2-solving) (CP2) - Just got to keep all of the question types fresh in my head
* 2.8 [Modelling with Differential Equations](Differential%20Equations.md#a-level-further-core-2-modelling) (CP2) - Just got to keep all of the question types fresh in my head
* 2.5 [Matrix Algebra](Matrices.md#a-level-further-pure-2-matrix-algebra) (FP2) - Got to memorise some key facts but there aren’t that many question types so I should be fine after doing a fair amount of questions
* 1.3 [Conic Sections 2](Conic%20Sections.md#a-level-further-pure-1-conic-sections-2) (FP1) - Got to memorise key parametric and cartesian equations as well as other stuff, Questions aren’t too hard
* 2.1 [\[Complex Numbers#A-Level Further Core 2|Exponential Form of Complex Numbers\]](CP2)

#### Need to remember specific facts/equations but can mostly solve questions with said facts given

* 1.3 [Conic Sections 2](Conic%20Sections.md#a-level-further-pure-1-conic-sections-2) (FP1) - Got to memorise key parametric and cartesian equations as well as other stuff, Questions aren’t too hard but do need a little practice
* 1.2 [Conic Sections 1](Conic%20Sections.md#a-level-further-pure-1-conic-sections-1) (FP1) - Got to memorise key parametric and cartesian equations as well as other stuff, Questions aren’t too hard but do need a little practice
* 2.6 [Integration Techniques](Integration.md#a-level-further-pure-2) (FP2) Need to memorise key formula for volume of revolution but questions aren’t too bad. Need lot’s of Practice on reduction formula
* 2.6 [Hyperbolic Trigonometric Functions](Hyperbolic%20Trigonometric%20Functions.md) (CP2) - Just need to flashcard memorise inverse functions in logarithms, derivatives and integrals
* 1.5 [The T-Formulae](The%20T-Formulae.md) (FP1) - Just need to flashcard memorise how to define trig functions in terms of $t$
* 1.4 [Sum and Product of Roots](Sum%20and%20Product%20of%20Roots.md) (CP1) - Just need to flashcard memorise formula
* 1.3 [Series](Series.md) (CP1) - Just need to memorise standard results

### Mostly got it

Overall just need to practice questions but not much memorisation needed

* 2.5 [Polar Coordinates](Polar%20Coordinates.md) (CP2)
* 1.6 [Matrices](Matrices.md) (CP1) - Need to remember determinant, inverses and multiplication
* 1.7 [Linear Transforms](Linear%20Transforms.md) (CP1)
* 1.8 [Proof By Induction](Proof%20By%20Induction.md) (CP1)
* 1.4 [Inequalities](Inequalities.md) (FP1)
* 1.7 [Methods In Calculus](Methods%20In%20Calculus.md) (FP1)
* 1.9 [Reducible Differential Equations](Differential%20Equations.md#a-level-further-pure-1-reducible-differential-equations)

### Easy

Only need to do a few questions

* 1.1 [Complex Numbers](Complex%20Numbers.md) (CP1)
* 1.2 [Complex Plane](Complex%20Plane.md) (CP1)
* 1.5 [Volumes Of Revolution](Volumes%20Of%20Revolution.md) (CP1)
* 2.4 [Volumes Of Revolution](Volumes%20Of%20Revolution.md) (CP2)
* 2.3 [Advanced Integration](Integration.md#a-level-further-core-2) (CP2)
* 2.2 [Advance Series](Series.md#a-level-further-core-2) (CP2)
* 2.3 [Complex Numbers](Complex%20Numbers.md#a-level-further-pure-2) (FP2)

# A-Level

Only included topics that I need to revise and omitted should need no dedicated revision

## Year 1

### Pure

* Trigonometric Equations and Identities
* Exponentials and Logarithms (more the data/modelling part)

### Stats

* Basically review everything - The maths itself is really straightforward just need to remember definitions and how to do questions

### Mechanics

* **NEED TO REMEMVER SUVAT** *and how to derive*
* A bit of gravity questions
* Connected particle questions - **ESPECIALLY SCALE PAN/LIFT/ELEVATOR WUESTIONS**
* Pulleys

## Year 2

### Pure

* A Bit of partial fractions
* Remember series definitions
* Binomial Expansion
* Trigonometric Modelling
* Implicit Differentiation
* Numerical Methods
* Integration Techniques
* A bit of Vectors

### Stats

* Review all of stats (Very short) mainly Normal distribution

### Mechanics

* Go over everything just do questions and as the actual maths is not difficult is just figuring what’s affecting what in the diagram
